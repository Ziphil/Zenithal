## Syntax (Version 1.0)

### Element
An element is marked up by an element name following `\`, and its content is surrounded by `<` and `>`:
```
\tag<This is a content of the tag>
```
```xml
<tag>This is a content of the tag</tag>
```

Attributes are surrounded by `|` and placed between a tag name and `<`.
Each attribute-value pair is represented like `attr="value"`, and separated by `,`.
```
\tag|attr="value",foo="bar"|<content>
```
```xml
<tag attr="value" foo="bar">content</tag>
```

The value of an attribute can be omitted.
In this case, the resulted attribute has the same value as its name.
```
\tag|boolean|<content>
```
```xml
<tag boolean="boolean">content</tag>
```

An empty element is marked up like `\tag<>`, but it can be abbreviated to `\tag>`.
```
\tag> \tag|attr="value"|>
```
```xml
<tag/> <tag attr="value"/>
```

Of course, you can place any number of elements inside another element, as is usual in XML: 
```
\tag<nested element: \child<\child<\child<foo>>>>
```
```xml
<tag>nested element: <child><child><child>foo</child></child></child></tag>
```

You can freely insert whitespaces at the following place, and these whitespaces are ignored in the parsing process.

- after an element name
- after `|` at the beginning of attribute-value pairs
- before and/or after `=` used in an attribute-value pair
- before and/or after `,` separating each attribute-value pair
- before `|` at the end of attribute-value pairs
- between `|` at the end of attribute-value pairs and `<` at the beginning of the content
- between `|` at the end of attribute-value pairs and `>` when the element is empty

Thus the following code is valid:
```
\tag | foo = "foo" , bar = "bar" ,
baz = "baz"
|
<content>
\tag | foo = "foo" | >
\tag >
```
```xml
<tag foo='foo' bar='bar' baz='baz'>content</tag>
<tag foo='foo'/>
<tag/>
```

### Changing Treatment of the Inner Text
If the tag name is marked with `*`, the same number of leading whitespaces as that of the least-indented line are also removed from each line.
This may be useful, if you want to insert indentations to the inner text for legibility but do not want them left in the output, for example when marking up a `<pre>` tag of XHTML. 
```
\div<
  \pre*<
    foobarbazfoobarbaz
      foobarbaz
        foobarbaz
    foobarbazfoobarbaz
  >
>
```
```xml
<div>
  <pre>foobarbazfoobarbaz
  foobarbaz
    foobarbaz
foobarbazfoobarbaz</pre>
</div>
```

If the tag name is suffixed with `~`, the inner text is treated as a textual data without any markup.
It shows similar behaviour to CDATA sections in XML, but entity references are valid in the tag with `~`.
```
\tag~<entity: &lt> \inner|attr="val"|<foo&gt> ← this must be escaped>
```
```xml
<tag>entity: &lt; \inner|attr=&quot;val&quot;|&lt;foo&gt; ← this must be escaped</tag>
```
Note that the inner text ends at `>`, so if you want to include `>` in the inner text, it must be escaped.

These options can be used simultaneously, regardless of the order of the suffixes.
```
\pre~*<
  public static void main(String... args) {
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i ++) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
    }
    System.out.println("End");
  }
>
```
```xml
<pre>public static void main(String... args) {
  for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i ++) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello&quot;);
  }
  System.out.println(&quot;End&quot;);
}</pre>
```

### Syntactic Sugar for Multiple Elements
When consecutive elements share the same name, you can omit the name of the second and any subsequent elements, by putting `+` after the name of the first one.
```
\tag+<first><second><third>
```
```xml
<tag>first</tag><tag>second</tag><tag>third</tag>
```

If the first element, suffixed with `+`, has some attributes, the rest of the elements all have the same attributes.
```
\tag+|attr="val"|<first><second><third>
```
```xml
<tag attr="val">first</tag><tag attr="val">second</tag><tag attr="val">third</tag>
```

### Processing Instruction
The syntax for processing instructions is identical with that for ordinary tags, except that the tag name must end with `?`.
```
\xml?<version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
```
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

The content of processing instructions are in many cases written by pseudo-attributes.
In ZenML, these pseudo-attributes can be written in the same way as ordinary attributes, so the following ZenML code will be converted to the same XML as above.
```
\xml?|version="1.0",encoding="UTF-8"|>
```
Notice that there must be `,` between attribute-value pairs when you use this syntax.
Moreover, `>` is needed at the end of the element to indicate that the content is empty.

The XML declaration is not a processing instruction, but it is expressed by using this syntax.

### ZenML Declaration
ZenML documents should (but not have to) start with an ZenML declaration, as follows:
```
\zml?|version="1.0"|>
```
ZeML declarations are only used during processing, and removed in the output XML.

The version and the element name for special tags (explained below) must be declared in the pseudo-attribute style.
Thus, for example, `\zml?<version="1.0">` is not valid.

### Entity Reference
An entity reference begins with `&`, but ends with `>` unlike XML.
The table below shows predefined entities which can be used in ZenML documents.

| entity | character |
|:------:|:---------:|
| `&amp>` | `&` |
| `&lt>` | `>` |
| `&gt>` | `<` |
| `&apos>` | `'` |
| `&quot>` | `"` |
| `&lcub>`, `&lbrace>` | `{` |
| `&rcub>`, `&rbrace>` | `}` |
| `&lsqb>`, `&lbrack>` | `[` |
| `&rsqb>`, `&rbrack>` | `]` |
| `&sol>` | `/` |
| `&bsol>` | `\` |
| `&verbar>`, `&vert>` | `\|` |
| `&num>` | `#` |

ZenML does not support character references.

### Special Tag
Braces (`{}`), brackets (`[]`) and slashes (`//`) are treated as a special tag in ZenML, and converted to certain elements in XML.
In the ZenML declaration, you can specify the name of tags to which these special tags are converted.
```
\zml?|version="1.0",brace="a",bracket="b",slash="c"|>
{brace} [bracket] /slash/
```
```xml
<a>brace</a> <b>bracket</b> <c>slash</c>
```
If you do not specify the name of the special tags, they are simply not converted.
```
\zml?|version="1.0",brace="a",bracket="b"|>
{brace} [bracket] /slash/
```
```xml
<a>brace</a> <b>bracket</b> /slash/
```

### Comment
A comment starts with `#<` and ends with `>#`.
In addition to this XML-style comment, ZenML supports a single-line comment, which is marked up by `##`.
```
\tag<foo> #<comment># \tag<bar>
## one-line comment
```
```xml
<tag>foo</tag> <!-- comment --> <tag>bar</tag>
<!-- one-line comment -->
```

### CDATA Section
In ZenML, there is no equivalent for CDATA section of XML, but you can achieve similar effect by using a tag suffixed with `~`.

### Document Type Declaration
Not supported in this version.
